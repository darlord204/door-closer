## File setup

Fill out the entire USER CONFIGURATION section of the code.

You should leave "STEPS_TO_CLOSE" at 12 to start with.  It can be adjusted for your specific blinds

## Home Assistant YAML

Replace "BlindsMCU" with your MQTT_CLIENT_ID if you changed it in the file setup

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Motorized Blinds"
    command_topic: "BlindsMCU/blindsCommand"
    set_position_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionCommand"
    position_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionState"
    state_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionState"
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    position_open: 0
    position_closed: 12
  ```
